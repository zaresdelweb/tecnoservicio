.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bpython/config\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The configuration file contains various options controlling the behaviour of
\fBbpython\fP\&.
.SH GENERAL
.sp
This refers to the \fB[general]\fP section in your \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bpython/config\fP file.
.SS auto_display_list
.sp
Display the autocomplete list as you type (default: True).
When this is off, you can hit tab to see the suggestions.
.SS autocomplete_mode
.sp
There are three modes for autocomplete. simple, substring, and fuzzy.
Simple matches methods with a common prefix, substring matches methods with a common
subsequence, and fuzzy matches methods with common characters (default:
simple).
.sp
New in version 0.12.

.SS syntax
.sp
Syntax highlighting as you type (default: True).
.SS arg_spec
.sp
Display the arg spec (list of arguments) for callables, when possible (default: True).
.SS hist_file
.sp
History file (default: \fB~/.pythonhist\fP).
.SS paste_time
.sp
The time between lines before pastemode is activated in seconds (default: 0.02).
.SS hist_length
.sp
Number of lines to store in history (set to 0 to disable) (default: 100)
.SS tab_length
.sp
Soft tab size (default 4, see pep\-8)
.SS pastebin_url
.sp
The pastebin url to post to (without a trailing slash). This pastebin has
to be a pastebin which uses LodgeIt. Examples are: \fI\%http://paste.pocoo.org/xmlrpc/\fP and
\fI\%http://bpaste.net/xmlrpc/\fP (default: \fI\%http://bpaste.net/xmlrpc/\fP)
.SS pastebin_private
.sp
If the pastebin supports a private option to make a random paste id, use it.
Default: True).
.sp
New in version 0.12.

.SS pastebin_show_url
.sp
The url under which the new paste can be reached. \fB$paste_id\fP will be
replaced by the ID of the new paste. Examples are: \fI\%http://bpaste.net/show/$paste_id/\fP
and \fI\%http://paste.pocoo.org/show/$paste_id/\fP (default: \fI\%http://bpaste.net/show/$paste_id/\fP)
.SS pastebin_helper
.sp
The name of a helper executable that should perform pastebin upload on bpython\(aqs
behalf. If set, this overrides \fIpastebin_url\fP\&. It also overrides \fIpastebin_show_url\fP,
as the helper is expected to return the full URL to the pastebin as the first word of
its output. The data is supplied to the helper via STDIN.
.sp
An example helper program is \fBpastebinit\fP, available for most systems. The
following helper program can be used to create \fI\%gists\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

def do_gist_json(s):
    """ Use json to post to github. """
    gist_public = False
    gist_url = \(aqhttps://api.github.com/gists\(aq

    data = {\(aqdescription\(aq: None,
            \(aqpublic\(aq: None,
            \(aqfiles\(aq : {

    data[\(aqdescription\(aq] = \(aqGist from BPython\(aq
    data[\(aqpublic\(aq] = gist_public
    data[\(aqfiles\(aq][\(aqsample\(aq][\(aqcontent\(aq] = s

    req = urllib2.Request(gist_url, json.dumps(data), {\(aqContent\-Type\(aq: \(aqapplication/json\(aq})
    try:
        res = urllib2.urlopen(req)
    except HTTPError, e:
        return e

    try:
        json_res = json.loads(res.read())
        return json_res[\(aqhtml_url\(aq]
    except HTTPError, e:
        return e

if __name__ == "__main__":
  s = sys.stdin.read()
  print do_gist_json(s)

.sp

.sp
If you set the colorscheme to \fIfoo\fP this will be translated to

to their respective control codes. If you configure a key combination which is not yet supported
by bpython it will raise an exception telling you the key does not exist in bpython.keys.
